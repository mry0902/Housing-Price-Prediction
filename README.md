# Housing Price Prediction


This is the final project for STA 521 Predictive Modeling at Duke University. The project is finished by a team with 4 members. Credits to my teammates: Liyu Gong, Yilin Gao, Wenqi Cheng, Mengrui Yin. 

The project is to analyze housing price in Ames, lowa, United States. Detailed description of the project is at [Introduction of Final-Data-Analysis](https://github.com/mry0902/Housing-Price-Prediction/blob/master/Final-Data-Analysis.Rmd).

Open Rstudio on saxon at http://saxon.stat.duke.edu:8787 or your local machine and login with your netid and password.

From the File menu in RStudio, select New Project, then the option Version Control and finally git. Enter the URL of the Team repo in the field and the other options and you should have a new project with the repo.

Open the file Final-Data-Analysis.Rmd in RStudio and add your code to the appropriate chunks. You can add additional chunks as needed interspersed with text to provide your answers.

You will have a passing badge if your code for creating predictions pass checks on wercker. If you do not have a passing badge above, click on the badge to go to wercker.com to identify the problems.
